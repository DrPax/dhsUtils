# dhsUtils

**Custom R tools for working with Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data**
Developed by DrPax for use in research, teaching, and training.

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

`dhsUtils` is a lightweight R package that simplifies the process of:
- Recoding DHS variables (e.g., sex, residence, religion)
- Displaying frequency tables in Stata-style format
- Preparing categorical variables for modeling
- Teaching descriptive statistics using labeled survey data

This package is designed for **researchers**, **educators**, and **students** working with DHS datasets in R.
